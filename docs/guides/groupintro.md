# Onboarding for New Group Members

A catch-all checklist for all possible new group members including academics, postdocs, technicians, grad students and even summer students.

# Meetings

The following are possible group meetings.

- Lunch with the PP group, everyday around noon, typically Vinen Room
- [BILPA Meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/category/9864/), Tuesdays at 11:00, W229
- [ATLAS Meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/category/10666/), Thursdays at 10:00, W229

Regular technical meetings should be scheduled with your supervisor.

# Computing

More information is available on the [UoB Particle System](http://www.ep.ph.bham.ac.uk/index.php?page=general/facilities/index) page. Contact Mark Slater to get an account. If you are an undergraduate student, your supervisor will do this for you.

# Communication

In-person and e-mail are possible ways of communicating. The Bham PP group also maintains a Mattermost Team. To join it, please share your CERN account with your supervisor. If you are an undergraduate student, you can register for a [CERN lightweight account](https://account.cern.ch/account/Externals/RegisterAccount.aspx).

A few notable channels are:

- __Social__: Organization of social events, including lunches and pub nights.
- __BILPA General__: General BILPA chatter.
- __BILPA Irradiations__: Discussion related to irradiations at MC40.
- __BILPA ITk Hybrids/Modules__: Discussions on ITk module/hybrid assembly.
