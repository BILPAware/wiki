ITk Module tests in the single-module testbox

NEW 9Nov23, Juergen Thomas (jpt@hep)
For: epldt126 (new PC)
Account: itkuser2

- Get a database token:

 cd /home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v9Nov23_FMCDP_local/production_database_scripts
 python get_token.py
 
Enter your password, copy/paste the output (very long hex code) 
into some file eg 'myToken.sh' and execute this file:

 source myToken.sh

- Switch-on the small chiller under the desk (Grant EcoCool), it's
 set to 18C, no need to change.
- Install module in the testbox (make sure the
 power supply outputs are off !)
- Set nitrogen flow to ~8l/min (above the 5l/min flow metre max)
- Wait for 5-10min, until the chiller is at +18C and the humidity is >5%
 The humidity sensor values are here, the 'NTC' is taped to the chuck:

- Switch-on LV power supply (TTI) and HV power supply (Keithley 2410).
- LV: power-up the Nexys (centre output of the TTI), wait until the
 row of green LEDs flashes intermittingly. Then power-up the module
 (left output of the TTI).
 Note: The HV is fully remote controlled, the front panel controls
 of the Keithley 2410 don't need to be and shouldn't be touched (!)

Before starting the DAQ, check in this file that the module is
correctly set in the DAQ configuration:

 gedit /home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v9Nov23_FMCDP_local/sctvar/st_system_config.dat &

The default is a LS module which has 'crossed HCC
bonds' (XHB). All modules like this have a sticker 'XHB' on
the transport box. Indeed all new modules are 'XHB'.
Only the uncommented lines are indeed
applied, namely this line, which is an LS with XHB:

 #        id CCR  s0  Name     (type)
 Module    0   0   0 JaneDoe0 Barrel_xHCC

The hybrid config now can be the same (!) for any module. Only
'LS' (one hybrid) and 'SS' (two hybrids), with XHB or not,
needs to be adjusted in this file, see comments in the file.
Make sure only the lines for the hybrid(s) required
are un-commented, ie one for LS, or two for SS.

Now ready to start-up the DAQ.
Go to the ITSDAQ installation:

 cd /home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v9Nov23_FMCDP_local

Set-up the environment (this is required every time)
and start ITSDAQ:

 source setup_al9_local_root6.26.sh
 cd itsdaq-sw/
 ./RUNITSDAQ.sh

Check for possible error messages. Esp if you see 'No AMAC found !',
this is a problem and the tests can't continue. Ask experts
for help (eg Juergen, Karol).
The Keithley 2410 HV will make a 'click' noise during this process,
this means it is in the correct 'REM' remote control mode.
Compared to earlier installations, this extra step is now required.
Without doing this, the setup is not ready:

 AutoConfig(false,false)

If everything looks ok, namely the ABC and HCC chip serial numbers
are showing, the test can continue. Otherwise, stop and ask
experts (eg Juergen, Karol).
Next step si to ramp the high voltage:
 
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-200,25)
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-350,40)

Note that while having the HV on, the black box _must not_ be opened. 
Run 'Full Test': 
Click 'Full Test' button in 'BurstData' GUI window under 'Test'.
This contains all the tests we require. 
It takes about 10min. When done, ramp HV (IMPORTANT: Never switch-off
LV power while HV is 'ON' - blue light on the Keithley 2410)
This is done in steps (the first number is the voltage, the second
is the 'compliance' current limit in muA):

 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-200,40)
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-200,22)
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-100,22)
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-100,11)
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-0,11)

Power-down the LV on the AMAC:

 AMACStar_DCDC(-1,0)

and leave ITSDAQ:

 .q

Now can switch-off the LV supplies, first the module
(left-hand output of TTI) then the Nexys (centre output of TTI).
Don't swap the module while the Nexys board is running !
This would be a 'hot swap' with active connections.

And switch-off the chiller if there are no more tests to do.
The nitrogen should be dialed-down to ~2 l/min, don't close
it completely as it is used for monitoring the nitrogen system.

Results are in:
 
/home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v9Nov23_FMCDP_local/sctvar/ps

and

/home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v9Nov23_FMCDP_local/sctvar/results

It makes sense to have a second terminal window open to 
check the results even while the test is still running.

 cd /home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v9Nov23_FMCDP_local/sctvar

 ls -ltr ps/* 
 ls -ltr results/*
 
The hybrid serial number is visible there, eg: SN20USBHX2001681. 
 
The 'headline' test result is the 'full response curve' noise
test, which is the second of the two 'RCPlot' tests.

 ls -ltr ps/*RCPlot*pdf

Check esp the bottom-left plots of p.1 and p.3, this is the input
noise. This ideally should be continuous and flat at about
800ENC for an LS module. Outliers above are (likely) shorted
channels (bonds or on the sensor), noise about 400ENC means
the sensor is not connected on this channel. 
The values from this test are here: 

 ls -ltr ps/*_RC_*txt

Finally, it makes sensor to zip-up the test results and copy
them onto /disk/moose/bilpa/atlas-itk/.
