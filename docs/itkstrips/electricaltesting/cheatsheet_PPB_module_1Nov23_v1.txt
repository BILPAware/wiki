ITk Module tests in the single-module testbox

- Get a database token:

 cd /home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v31Oct23_FMCDP_local/production_database_scripts
 python get_token.py
 
Enter your password, copy/paste the output (very long hex code) 
into some file eg 'myToken.sh' and execute this file:

 source myToken.sh

- Switch-on the small chiller under the desk (Grant EcoCool), it's
 set to 18C, no need to change.
- Install module in the testbox (power supply outputs off !)
- Set nitrogen flow to ~8l/min (above the 5l/min flow metre max)
- Wait for 5-10min, until the chiller is at +18C and the humidity is >5%
 The humidity sensor values are here, the 'NTC' is taped to the chuck:
  
 eplpi001.ph.bham.ac.uk/temphum.php
 
- Switch-on LV power supply (TTI) and HV power supply (Keithley 2410).
- LV: power-up the Nexys (centre output of the TTI), wait until the
 row of green LEDs flashes intermittingly. Then power-up the module
 (left output of the TTI).
 Note: The HV is fully remote controlled, the front panel controls
 of the Keithley 2410 don't need to be and shouldn't be touched (!)

Go to the ITSDAQ installation:

 cd /home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v31Oct23_FMCDP_local

Set-up and start ITSDAQ:

 source setup_al9_local_root6.26.sh
 cd itsdaq-sw/
 ./RUNITSDAQ.sh
 
Hybrid config now can be the same (!) for any module.
No need anymore to edit 'st_system_config.dat', already correctly set.
_But_ it requires this extra step, without doing this, the setup 
is not ready:

 AutoConfig(false,false)

Ramp HV:
 
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-200,25)
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-350,40)

Run 'Full Test': 
Click 'Full Test' button in 'BurstData' GUI window under 'Test'.

Takes about 10min. When done, ramp HV (IMPORTANT: Never switch-off
LV power while HV is 'ON' - blue light on the Keithley 2410)

 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-200,40)
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-200,22)
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-100,22)
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-100,11)
 HVSupplies[0]->Ramp(-0,11)

Power-down the LV on the AMAC:

 AMACStar_DCDC(-1,0)

and leave ITSDAQ:

 .q

Now can switch-off the LV supplies, first the module
(left-hand output of TTI) then the Nexys (centre output of TTI).
Don't swap the module while the Nexys board is running !
This would be a 'hot swap' with active connections.

And switch-off the chiller if there are no more tests to do.
The nitrogen should be dialed-down to ~2l/min, don't close
it completely as it is used for monitoring the nitrogen system.

Results are in:
 
/home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v31Oct23_FMCDP_local/sctvar/ps

and

/home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v31Oct23_FMCDP_local/sctvar/results

It makes sense to have a second terminal window open to 
check the results even while the test is still running.

 cd /home/itkuser2/itsdaq/itsdaq_v31Oct23_FMCDP_local/sctvar

 ls -ltr ps/* 
 ls -ltr results/*
 
The hybrid serial number is visible there, eg: SN20USBHX2001681. 
 
The 'headline' test result is the 'full response curve' noise
test, which is the second of the two 'RCPlot' tests.

 ls -ltr ps/*RCPlot*pdf

Check esp the bottom-left plots of p.1 and p.3, this is the input
noise. This ideally should be continuous and flat at about
800ENC for an LS module. Outliers above are (likely) shorted
channels (bonds or on the sensor), noise about 400ENC means
the sensor is not connected on this channel. 
The values from this test are here: 

 ls -ltr ps/*_RC_*txt

Finally, it makes sensor to zip-up the test results and copy
them onto /disk/moose/bilpa/atlas-itk/.
